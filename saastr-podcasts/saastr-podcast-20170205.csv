Allison’s organization @ Gainsight includes all post-sales functions: CSMs, Support, Onboarding, Services, and Operations. Prior to Gainsight, she started her career in management consulting for Fortune 500 companies while at Boston Consulting Group and later worked in private equity investing at Bain Capital.  Allison decided that she couldn’t pass up the opportunity to work at Gainsight when Bain Capital led the Series B. In Today’s Episode With Allison You Will Learn: 1.) So let’s start with managing customer churn and I think the first and most important thing is assessing what is regrettable vs non-regrettable. How do you approach this?  What is the internal post mortem? How do you identify why they churned? Is there a blame game that follows? How do you instill ramifications but not fear? How do you then look to fix the original problem that caused the churn?  2.) To do the above we need to have a great customer success team so iw ant to talk about the process of building this out and with CS being a new category this is an aspect a lot of founders are addressing at this time. So starting with the obvious?  When do you need a customer success team? Where in the organization should the team sit? What's the playbook for rolling it out? How big does the team need to be? Does this vary on sector or funding availability? What are the levels of seniority within the team? What's your budget? How do you account for the costs of your team? What teams sit within the customer success umbrella?  60 Second Saastr produced by Nick Mehta: What surprises you most about customer success now vs a year ago? Importance of fast iterating team? Fave SaaS material, book, blog, podcast? What element of the journey have you found most challenging? Carrying the CS torch? What is it like do you feel the pressure? 3.) Now I want to finish today by discussing the segmentation of your customer base, so at what point in the company's life do you begin segmenting the customers?  Why is it important to segment customers? How do you decide the best way to segment them? Should these segments align with the sales team?    If you would like to find out more about the show and the guests presented you can follow us on Twitter here:  Jason Lemkin Harry Stebbings Saastr Allison Pickens ",7/18/2016 2:52:52,Allison Pickens,VP Customer Success,Gainsight,Customer Success,change managment (lots or reorganization in hypergrowth),NA,"managing customer churn: every churn is regrettable, should cause a root cause analysis that ends with action items; 8 different categories of risk, like adoption risk, sentiment risk (NPS), product risk (enhancement request), implementation risk (onboarding time to value), etc.; default should be that CSM isn't necessarily the fault of churn and why you need to do root cause analysis; CSM content (all post-sales functions): onboarding, technical success and operations within the CSM umbrella; when do you need a CSM team: startup that is a big part of your time and creating a tight feedback loop; then create awesome customer advocates; first CS person: early on need a very diverse skillset (jack of all trades and learn very quickly; create struture from ambiguity), the sales learning curve ""the renaissance rep""; a way to eventually specialize -- onboarding (different workflow) and then operations (analytics); CS has been adopted very quickly in non-saas companies (everyone is becoming a tech company); important to observe differences around customers and see how they group together (and determine their key needs), then boil down to a key attribute; "

Sometimes, ignoring conventional wisdom is what will differentiate you from the competition. Bootstrapping from day one, launching and supporting multiple products, and doing it all without traditional Sales team - Atlassian's approach (and wild success) has always been a curious anomaly in SaaS. After 13 years of being an exception to every rule, Atlassian went public in late 2015 with a total market capitalization of $4.37B at the time of the IPO. In this session, Jay answers our burning questions:  1.) Why does Jay believe in most cases the best run companies are public companies? What does being public bring to the organizational structure of a firm? 2.) How important is it for early stage startups to have board members and outside perspectives? How should they select those inputs? 3.) How important a role does customer support and success play in the conversion of customers from trial to paid versions?  4.) How does Jay focus on 4 products with such a differentiated suite of products? Does this not contradict the often cited fundamental, focus.
